This application will allow an event administrator the ability to create a racing event, including details about that particular race. The application will also capture team membersâ€™ hotel information for each event in the competitive season with an event-specific survey.  

The information gleaned from the survey will provide the event administrator with lodging and travel preferences so that he or she can more easily begin the process of booking hotel accommodations.

Once the administrator has selected a hotel for an event, he or she will create a hotel block in the Admin section of the application. The application will create a private forum for team members to arrange and adjust their specific hotel needs. 

After the room assignment deadline has passed, the application will generate a report which the administrator can send to the hotel to book the rooms. Hotel room numbers can be assigned to the rooms, and a team member report can be generated to distribute team contact information while at the event. 

In addition to more transparency and accessibility for team members, the application will allow the administrator the power to create reports for all events relating to the team.
